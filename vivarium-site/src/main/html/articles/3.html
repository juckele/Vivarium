      All of the values discussed in this article are default values. The Vivarium code allows most of these values and some of these behaviors to be overridden on a per simulation basis.

      Creatures in Vivarium, like biological life forms, are limited by finite resources. The most critical resource for a vivarium creature is energy. Each creature has an energy store with a maximum value of 2,000. Creatures which reach zero energy die and are removed from the simulation. Creatures lose energy passively during each tick, and some actions have additional energy costs. Creatures gain energy when they eat food, but any excess energy beyond the creatures energy cap is wasted. Figure 3.1 shows the energy gain and loss from different sources.

      Another limit that Vivarium creatures must cope with is a finite lifespan. A creature ages during every tick, and a creature has a maximum age of 20,000. Creatures that reach the maximum age will die of old age and be removed from the simulation. The limited lifespans end up being very important because mortal creatures place a higher emphasis on breeding, which allows a faster generational iteration.
