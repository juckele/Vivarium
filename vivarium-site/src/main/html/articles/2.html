	<h4>The motivation of Vivarium</h4>

      Vivarium is a research project aimed to create general intelligent models. If we look to humans as an example, we can see humans express the capacity to form, apply and update models deliberately and recursively. An attempt to seek out and emulate this foundational recursion is central to the the design of Vivarium.

    <paragraph>
      The most obvious problem with building general models of intelligence is that such models are very difficult to evaluate, because there is not a strong understanding of the building blocks of intelligence. Without a clear cost function which can be used to measure incremental improvement, many techniques employed in machine learning for automatic model construction are unsuitable in the search for general intelligent models.

      The basic hypothesis for vivarium is that a well understood cost function for solving a problem can be replaced with an implicit cost function in the form of an environment which would benefit creatures that are better able to solve the problem.
