# Vivarium

Vivarium is an artificial life simulation, and how I spend much of my time 
outside of work.

## Motivation

The project is based on the hypothesis that a genetic algorithm is limited by 
its fitness function, and that designing a sufficient fitness function for a 
poorly understood task is unapproachably difficult.

## Recent Work

I've recently launched vivrium.io to serve as a place to demo the project and 
share articles I've written about vivarium.
