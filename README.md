# Vivarium

Vivarium is an artificial life simulation, and how I spend much of my time outside of work.

## Motivation

The project is based on the hypothesis that a genetic algorithm is limited by its fitness function, and that designing a sufficient fitness function for a poorly understood task is unapproachably difficult.

## Recent Work

The project has since grown much bigger, and I've added functionality to explore many options within the simulations.
